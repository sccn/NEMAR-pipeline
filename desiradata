Want a script that can 
- create directory under logs for each dataset
- create a sbatch file for just that dataset and save it under logs
	- The file should be self-executable
	- The logging of the sbatch should be put under that directory
- submit the sbatch job
- be executed from the command line without loading matlab for convenience
